It's about time to drop support for old Pythons.

## How to use

```bash
usage: generate.py [-h] [-n NUMBER] [-v VERSION [VERSION ...]]

Generate

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -n NUMBER, --number NUMBER
                        Number of packages to chart (default: 360)
  -v VERSION [VERSION ...], --version VERSION [VERSION ...]
                        Python version or versions to check (default: ['2.6',
                        '3.2', '3.3'])
```

For example:
```bash
$ python3 generate.py

$ python3 generate.py -v 3.2 -n 100

$ python3 generate.py -v 2.6
```
See also `build.sh`.

Gets list of packages from [Top PyPI Packages](https://hugovk.github.io/top-pypi-packages/).

## How to test locally

In another terminal:
```bash
$ python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit http://localhost:8000/

## How to deploy

Make sure we're on `main` and run `crontask.sh` daily from cron.
